    print_text('\nOut of nowhere, the chess-playing robot swooped down, its arms outstretched. It grabbed Pete and lifted him high above the city. "Hold on tight!" the robot called, its voice filled with urgency.\n')

    print_text('\n“This is no time to play chess!” Pete cried. “But you can keep saving me if you want. I like this part.”\n')

    print_text("\nAs they flew away, a sudden downpour of viscous, warm rain began to pour down from the sky. The robot's grip weakened, and Pete felt himself slipping. Despite the robot's best efforts, Pete's hands slipped free, and he plummeted toward the earth.\n")

    print_text("\nJust before he struck the ground, Pete awoke with a start. He found himself back in the forest, with Hamilton's wet snout nudging his face and his tail wagging happily.\n")

    print_text('\n"Oh," Pete murmured, relief washing over him. “I guess I fell asleep when I bonked my head on that statue. I went to the most fantastical place, and you were there, Hamilton.” He hugged Hamilton tightly, grateful to be back in the familiar woods with his beloved truffle-hunting pig. “Let’s go home.”\n')
