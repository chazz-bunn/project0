The dark, damp tunnels twisted and turned, and the air was thick with the smell of decay. Pete's footsteps echoed eerily as he navigated the maze-like passages.\n")

He turned a corner and found himself face-to-face with a group of sewer bears, their eyes glowing menacingly in the dim light. These were no ordinary sewer bearsâ€”they were the bad kind, fierce and relentless.\n")

    print_text("\nBefore Pete could react, the sewer bears lunged at him. Their claws and teeth tore through the air, and Pete's cries were quickly silenced as they overwhelmed him. The sewers grew quiet once more. The only sounds were the distant dripping of water and the faint rustle of fur.\n")
